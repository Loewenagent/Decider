# The-for-you-decider
You have thousands of things you could do but can't decide it for yourself?
Dinner will be soon but don't know what to eat?
Or the most important question: Which is better, peach or lemon ice tea?
No prob, as there is this piece of shit now.
The-for-you-decider!

## TODO
- Documentatation
- Command "use" needs renaming
- Suggestion: Layout (e.g. bigger distance for not found command)
- Suggestion: colored intro
- Suggestion: progress bar
- Update lines instead of just printing them new (e.g. progress bar or ">> ")
