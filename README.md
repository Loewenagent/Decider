# The-for-you-decider
You have thousands of things you could do but can't decide it for yourself?
Dinner will be soon but don't know what to eat?
Or the most important question: Which is better, peach or lemon ice tea?
No prob, as there is this piece of shit now.
The-for-you-decider!


## Voraussetzungen
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)


## Installation
Just extract everything from the .zip file (if you didn't do that already) and ... voilà !


## Usage
- Double-click "decide.py"
- open a CMD or something similiar and execute "decide.py" in there, if you know how to, of course.

## TODO
- Documentatation
- command "use" needs renaming
- Suggestion: Layout(e.g. bigger distance for not found command)
- Suggestion: colored Intro
- Suggestion: progress bar
- Update lines instead of just printing them new (e.g. progress bar or ">> ")
